# Superfields

Create fields with pre-populated values for:

- Country, month or weekday, with support for choosing the language for field values

- Year - specifying the selection range

- Time - specifying the selection range and gap between selections

## Installation

1. This is a custom block. To install custom blocks, you need to join Airtable's custom blocks developer preview, by filling [this form](https://airtable.com/shrEvq5IlQqYxWkaS).

2.

## Contributions

Are more than welcome. The goal is to have the community expand the block and it's field selection so that the entire Airtable community can benefit.

Some things that might benefit the community:

- Option to create the field as a linked record to a new table with the pre-populated values.

- Option to create the field as a multiple select field.

- Support for displaying different languages in different Airtable forms. If someone wants to add this, feel free to open an issue so I can suggest one possible way of implementing this.
